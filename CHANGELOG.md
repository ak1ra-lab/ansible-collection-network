## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial collection with three roles:
  - `tproxy` — engine-agnostic TPROXY transparent proxy plumbing (nftables
    marking, policy routing, sysctl), extracted from
    `ak1ra-lab/sing-box-tproxy` `roles/sing_box_tproxy` and renamed to the
    `tproxy_*` variable contract.
  - `flow_offload` — nftables flowtable offloading for forwarded traffic
    (opt-in, independent).
  - `proxy_guard` — per-client TCP abuse protection with throttle / auto-ban
    (opt-in, independent).
- Declarative state for every role: `<role>_state` (default `present`);
  `absent` atomically tears down the role's own artifacts via
  `tasks/reset.yaml`, leaving shared system files untouched.

### Fixed

- `proxy_guard` restores the guard parameter defaults its README documents -
  `proxy_guard_lan4_subnets` (the RFC 1918 trio) and
  `proxy_guard_lan6_subnets` (`[]`), the throttle set
  (`false` / `600` / `150` / `2m`) and the auto-ban set
  (`false` / `1200` / `300` / `5m`) - which the collection split dropped
  together with the switch gating.
